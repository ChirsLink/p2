/**
 * An Iterable list that is implemented using a singly-linked chain of nodes
 * with a header node and without a tail reference.
 * 
 * The "header node" is a node without a data reference that will 
 * reference the first node with data once data has been added to list.
 * 
 * The iterator returned is a LinkedListIterator constructed by passing 
 * the first node with data.
 * 
 * CAUTION: the chain of nodes in this class can be changed without
 * calling the add and remove methods in this class.  So, the size()
 * method must be implemented by counting nodes.  This counting must
 * occur each time the size method is called.  DO NOT USE a numItems field.
 * 
 * COMPLETE THIS CLASS AND HAND IN THIS FILE

	//	 It must have a "header node" ("dummy node" without data)
	//	 It must NOT have a tail reference
	//	 It must NOT keep a number of data items
	//       NOTE: in this program, the chains of nodes in this program may be 
	//   	 changed outside of the LinkedList class, so the actual data count 
	//       must be determined each time size is called.
	//
	//	 It must return a LinkedListIterator<E> as its iterator.
	//	 
	//	 Note: The "header node"'s data reference is always null and 
	//	 its next references the node with the first data of the list.
	//	 
	//	 Be sure to implement this LinkedList<E> using Listnode
	//	       you must use LinkedListIterator<E> instead of Iterator<E>
